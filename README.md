# caveman2-example

This is my study project of the Common Lisp web framework caveman2.
As soon as I finish this study, I will write a complete tutorial on it, from installing a version of Common Lisp up to deploying a Lisp web application to a Digital Ocean droplet.

### Examples I am going to implement in this project:
    - [x] Simple AJAX request;
    - [] Database example (CRUD);    
    - [] Templating with Djula + db example;
    - [] Session example;
    - [] Deploying a CL web app.

I think with these examples I will be able to cover most of the necessary items to build and deploy a web application using Caveman2.
