# caveman2-example

This is my study project of the Common Lisp web framework caveman2.
I plan on writing a simple and functional web application as soon as I am finished with this study, and then write a full on tutorial on that.
In the meanwhile, someone who wants to get started on the caveman2 framework but wants some working example codes on how to do basic stuff with it, can follow this project. 

### Examples I am going to implement in this project:
- [x] Simple AJAX request;
- [ ] Database example (CRUD);    
- [ ] Templating with Djula + db example;
- [ ] Session example;
- [ ] Deploying a CL web app.

I think with these examples I will be able to cover most of the necessary items to build and deploy a web application using Caveman2.


### Contents:
    All of the database related functions can be found in the src/db.lisp file.
    All of the routing related functions can be found in the src/web.lisp file.
    All the html files can be found in the /templates/ folder.
    All the css and js used can be found in the /static/ folder


### KEEP IN MIND!

#### What this project is not:
This project is NOT a tutorial on how to develop proper web applications in Common Lisp;
This project is NOT a project that utilizes all the features in the caveman2 framework;
This project is NOT intended to be the only reference one would have when getting into web-applications in Common lisp.

#### What this project is:
This project IS a basic walkthrough of some of the caveman2 framework features;
This project IS intended to people who already know how to program in lisp;
This project IS intended to help people starting on web development studies in Common Lisp.
